     Think not some knowledge rests with thee alone;
        Why, even God's stupendous secret, Death,
        We one by one, with our expiring breath,
    Do pale with wonder seize and make our own;
    The bosomed treasures of the earth are shown,
        Despite her careful hiding; and the air
        Yields its mysterious marvels in despair
    To swell the mighty store-house of things known.
    In vain the sea expostulates and raves;
        It cannot cover from the keen world's sight
        The curious wonders of its coral caves.
    And so, despite thy caution or thy tears,
    The prying fingers of detective years
        Shall drag thy secret out into the light.
