# Secrets
Think not some knowledge rests with thee *alone*;
Why, even God's stupendous **secret**, _Death_,
We one by one, with our expiring *breath*,
Do pale with wonder seize and make our own;
The bosomed **treasures** of the earth are *shown*,
Despite her careful hiding; and the _air_
Yields its mysterious marvels in *despair
To swell the mighty store-house of things _known_.
In vain the sea **expostulates** and *raves*;
It cannot cover from the keen world's _sight_
The **curious** wonders of its coral *caves*.
And so, despite thy caution or thy _tears_,
The prying fingers of detective *years*
hall drag thy ~~secret~~ out into the _light_.
